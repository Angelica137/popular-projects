# Python popular projects

In this project I use the Github API to find and visualise the most starred Python projects in Github.

This program automatically creates and api call and processes the results in a barchart with clickable links to each repo.

Technologies used:

- Python
- Plotly

To run the project run the command
`python python_repos_visualisation.py`
